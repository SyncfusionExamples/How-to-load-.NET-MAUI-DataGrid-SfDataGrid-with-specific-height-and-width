# How to load .NET MAUI DataGrid SfDataGrid with specific height and width
You can load the [SfDataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid) with specific height and width in various layouts by utilizing the `SfDataGrid.HeightRequest` and `SfDataGrid.WidthRequest` properties. It's important to adjust the HorizontalOptions and VerticalOptions for the grid accordingly.

For instance, when defining a width request, ensure that the HorizontalOptions of the `SfDataGrid` align with your requirements. Similarly, when specifying a height request, configure the VerticalOptions of the grid accordingly. In the event of setting both, make sure to adjust both HorizontalOptions and VerticalOptions accordingly.

##### Xaml:
 
 ```XML
<syncfusion:SfDataGrid ColumnWidthMode="Auto"
                       HeightRequest="300"
                       VerticalOptions="Center"
                       ItemsSource="{Binding Employees}">

</syncfusion:SfDataGrid>
 ```
 

Executing the code example above yields the following output.
